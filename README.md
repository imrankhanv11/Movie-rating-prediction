🎬 Movie Rating Prediction 🌟
Welcome to the Movie Rating Prediction project! This Python-based tool uses machine learning algorithms to predict movie ratings based on various features. 📊✨

📊 Overview
This project utilizes SVR, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms to estimate a movie's rating based on user-input features such as:

🎫 Certificate (e.g., PG-13)
👍 Votes: Number of votes received
⏳ Duration: Length of the movie in minutes
🎭 Genre: Type of movie (e.g., Action, Comedy)
🎥 Director: The filmmaker behind the movie
🚀 Features
Data Cleaning: Removes irrelevant columns and fills missing values.
Exploding Genres: Supports multiple genres per movie.
Model Training: Trains multiple regression models for accurate predictions.
User Input: Allows users to input movie details and get predicted ratings instantly.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn & Plotly: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
📈 Getting Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-rating-prediction.git
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas seaborn plotly scikit-learn matplotlib
Load the dataset and run the movie_rating_prediction.py script to start predicting!
🎤 Usage
Input the following movie details when prompted:

Certificate: Type the movie's certificate (e.g., PG-13)
Votes: Enter the total number of votes
Duration: Specify the duration in minutes
Genre: Provide the genre of the movie
Director: Enter the director's name
The model will then predict the movie's rating using the trained algorithms!

📊 Model Evaluation
The project evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score, ensuring accurate predictions.
